<h1>My favorite Anime</h1>
<h2>Top 3 anime according to Obinna</h2>

<hr />

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows that One Piece is one of the best animes known to man. Alright that might sound a bit biased but seriously. It's my fav of all time.</p>

<h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
<p>
    A close second to One piece for me. Hunter x Hunter is one of those animes where i never got tired of watching it. Amazing worldbuilding and characters.

<h3>Re:Zero</h3>

    Third place spot for me is pretty open, but i usualy always find myself putting this here. It's just one of those animes that keeps you on your toes the whole way through.
